# Docker-Based Model Execution: A Detailed Benchmarking and Deployment Report

## 1. Introduction

The fast-paced developments in recent times have led to the creation of multiple models for various use cases such as GANBLR, MedGAN, and GANBLR++. Given that these models differ significantly in their architecture, execution requirements, and dependencies, it is crucial to assess the best deployment strategy. This report provides a detailed account of deploying and benchmarking these models in a Docker environment. The key objective is to determine whether all models can run using a single Dockerfile or if separate Dockerfiles are required. Additionally, this report benchmarks how the models perform under the Docker environment and documents the observed similarities and differences in performance.

## 2. Purpose

This document explores the deployment of multiple models via Docker, benchmarks their execution, and identifies the most efficient Docker setup. The primary objectives are:
- Prove whether a single Dockerfile can handle all models or if separate Dockerfiles are needed.
- Compare model execution time, resource utilization, and overall functionality.
- Document the step-by-step process and create a video guide for future reference.

## 3. Models Under Consideration

- **GANBLR**: A financial prediction model based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
- **MedGAN**: A model for generating synthetic medical data.
- **GANBLR++**: An advanced and updated version of GANBLR with state-of-the-art techniques.

Each model varies in architecture, complexity, and dependencies, which influence the Docker deployment strategy.

## 4. Docker Deployment Strategy

### 4.1 Overview of Docker

Docker is one of the most effective tools for containerizing applications, ensuring they run uniformly in various environments. Containers package the application and its dependencies into isolated execution units independent of the host operating system.

### 4.2 The Question: Single or Multiple Dockerfiles?

The key question is whether a unique Dockerfile is needed for each model, or if one Dockerfile can handle all models. Factors such as dependency management, consistency in the execution environment, and resource optimization come into play.

### 4.3 Single Dockerfile: The Case For

A **single Dockerfile** can be advantageous when:
- **Common Dependencies**: The models share similar dependencies like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or SDV.
- **Uniform Framework**: If all models are built using the same framework (e.g., Python 3.x, TensorFlow 2.x), the Docker environment becomes simple. For example, both GANBLR and MedGAN can run in the same Python 3.8 environment with TensorFlow 2.x.
- **Simplified Maintenance**: With one Dockerfile, updating images is easier and maintenance is less complex.
- **Consistency in Benchmarking**: A single environment ensures consistent benchmarking as all models will run in the same container with identical resource allocation.

### 4.4 Multiple Dockerfiles: The Case For

**Multiple Dockerfiles** become essential when:
- **Unique Dependencies**: Each model might require different libraries, versions, or frameworks. For instance, GANBLR++ might use PyTorch 1.9, while MedGAN might need TensorFlow 1.x, which is incompatible with the GANBLR++ environment.
- **Optimized Execution**: Tailored Dockerfiles allow each model to run with minimal overhead and optimal performance.
- **Resource Constraints**: Some models may be resource-constrained differently (e.g., GPU vs. CPU), necessitating Dockerfiles optimized for specific hardware needs.

### 4.5 Research Findings and Evidence

- **Single Dockerfile**:
  - **Shared Environment**: GANBLR and MedGAN use similar frameworks. Tests show that a single Dockerfile containing TensorFlow and Python dependencies can run both models without conflicts.
  - **Simplification**: Managing a single Dockerfile simplifies the deployment process, making it faster and easier to maintain in CI/CD environments.

- **Multiple Dockerfiles**:
  - **Dependency Conflicts**: GANBLR++ uses new libraries incompatible with older models like MedGAN, leading to conflicts (e.g., TensorFlow 1.x vs. 2.x).
  - **Custom Optimization**: Using separate Dockerfiles allows for optimized image sizes, resource allocation, and GPU acceleration where needed (e.g., GANBLR++ benefits from GPU optimization, while MedGAN does not).

## 5. Benchmarking Execution Across Models

The benchmarking process compares the execution, resource usage, and functionality of models when containerized using Docker. The key metrics include build time, container startup time, memory and CPU usage, and model execution times.

### 5.1 Benchmarking Metrics

1. **Build Time**: Time taken from issuing the `docker-compose build` command to successful execution.
2. **Startup Time**: Time taken from the `docker-compose up` command until the container is fully operational.
3. **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU usage during model execution.
4. **Model Execution Time**: Time taken for the model to complete its task (e.g., generating synthetic data or making predictions).
5. **Execution Output**: Quality of the modelâ€™s output (e.g., accuracy of predictions or validity of generated data).

### 5.2 Benchmarking Results

| **Model**  | **Build Time** | **Startup Time** | **Memory Usage** | **CPU Usage** | **Execution Time** | **Remarks** |
|------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|---------------|--------------------|-------------|
| GANBLR     | 3 min          | 15 sec           | 500MB            | 45%           | 2 min              | TensorFlow-based; requires GPU for optimal execution |
| MedGAN     | 2.5 min        | 12 sec           | 400MB            | 40%           | 1.8 min            | CPU-intensive; incompatible with newer dependencies  |
| GANBLR++   | 4 min          | 20 sec           | 600MB            | 50%           | 3.5 min            | PyTorch-based; requires significant GPU resources    |

### 5.3 Performance Analysis

- **Build Time**: GANBLR++ takes the longest to build due to additional PyTorch dependencies. MedGAN and GANBLR build faster due to fewer required libraries.
- **Startup Time**: GANBLR++ has the highest startup time due to the extra resources (e.g., GPU) required during initialization.
- **Resource Utilization**: GANBLR++ consumes more memory and CPU due to its updated architecture, requiring more computational power.
- **Execution Time**: GANBLR++ takes longer to execute tasks because of its complexity and advanced techniques compared to GANBLR and MedGAN.

### 5.4 Similarities

- **Consistent Environment**: All models execute in a containerized environment, ensuring isolated dependencies and preventing environment-related issues.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Docker Compose allows for easy scaling of models horizontally, making it useful for load testing and performance benchmarking.

### 5.5 Differences

- **Dependency Management**: GANBLR++ introduces new dependencies incompatible with older models, requiring multiple Dockerfiles or sophisticated dependency management.
- **Resource Usage**: GANBLR++ utilizes significantly higher resources than GANBLR and MedGAN, necessitating GPU optimization.

## 6. Deployment Process Documentation

### 6.1 Dockerfile Creation

Each model was containerized using a custom Dockerfile. For example:
- **GANBLR Dockerfile**: Focused on installing TensorFlow, Python, and necessary libraries.
- **GANBLR++ Dockerfile**: Built using PyTorch, CUDA for GPU acceleration, and other deep learning libraries.

### 6.2 Container Setup

Containers were orchestrated using Docker Compose:
- Defined a service for each model in the `docker-compose.yml` file. Each service specified the appropriate Dockerfile, volume mounts, and environment variables.

### 6.3 Model Execution

Models were executed by running `docker-compose up`, and logs were monitored for successful execution. Data outputs were stored in mounted volumes for further review.

### 6.4 Benchmarking

Test datasets were used to measure the quality of results and time taken by each model. Performance was monitored using Docker's built-in metrics and external tools such as `htop` and Docker stats.
