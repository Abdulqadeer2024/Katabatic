### Summary of Katabatic Framework for understanding:

### - Allan Odunga

**Overview:**

-   Katabatic is a Python framework for generating synthetic tabular data.
-   It standardizes the evaluation of different generative models, allowing fair comparisons.
-   It accommodates a range of models and includes service provider interfaces (SPIs) for easy integration.
-   The framework is open-source and designed for data scientists, researchers, and practitioners.

**Key Components:**

1. **Generative Models:**

    - **Vanilla GANs:** Simple architecture using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
    - **Conditional GANs:** Use conditional vectors to specify labels during training.
    - **Bayesian Network Inspired Generators (GANBLR):** Use Bayesian Networks to map causal links between features, optimizing conditional log-likelihoods.

2. **Design Philosophy:**

    - Easy to use and assess without prior machine learning knowledge.
    - Supports both discrete and continuous data generation.
    - Intuitive API conventions similar to scikit-learn.
    - Multiprocessing capability for running models concurrently.
    - Declarative module loading for scalability.

3. **Evaluation Methods:**
    - **Privacy Preservation:** Using methods like Nearest Neighbour Adversarial Accuracy (NNAA) to assess the risk of reconstructing original data.
    - **Utility Testing:** Evaluating model compatibility and accuracy using metrics like F1 score and TSTR.

### GANBLR Specifics:

**Overview:**

-   **GANBLR (Generative Adversarial Network with Bayesian Logistic Regression):** Combines GANs with Bayesian Networks.
-   **Architecture:**
    -   **Generator:** Trains a K-dependent Bayesian Network (KDB).
    -   **Discriminator:** Uses Logistic Regression with KDB.
-   **Advantages:**
    -   Produces state-of-the-art results.
    -   Interpretable as model parameters represent probabilities.
    -   Optimizes conditional log-likelihood of model parameters.

**Implementation Notes:**

-   Ensure you understand Bayesian Networks and logistic regression basics.
-   Utilize Katabaticâ€™s SPI for model integration.
-   Focus on understanding conditional probabilities and log-likelihood optimization for fine-tuning the model.
